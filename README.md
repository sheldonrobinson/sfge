SFGE is a behaviour based game engine

It is highly inspired by Marcy's 2009 GDC presentation, [Theory and Practice of Game Object Component Architecture](https://www.gdcvault.com/free/gdc-canada-09)

## Dependencies
To compile this project, make sure to tweak the property sheet of each dependencies. You'll found them in the root folder (except for delegates).

* VC++ 2010
* boost
* Qt for the editor
* SFML2 (commit 17971ca198b484a52bad)
* [Impossibly Fast Delegates](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/11015/The-Impossibly-Fast-C-Delegates) (integrated in SFGE code base for easy reuse since messaging is part of the core logic)
